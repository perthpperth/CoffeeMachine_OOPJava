# CoffeeMachine - OOP Java 

The CoffeeMachine Java application is a graphical user interface (GUI) based system built using Swing, simulating an ordering system for a cafe. It consists of a panel displaying customer information, checkboxes representing various coffee options, and a dynamic total price display.

## Features
- **User Interaction:** Users input their name and select from a menu of coffee choices, each with a specific price and coffee bean type. Selections dynamically update the displayed total price.
- **Responsive Interface:** The interface responds to user interactions such as checkbox selection, text input, and key events. Upon selecting items and pressing enter, the application generates an order summary with the customer's name and the chosen options.
- **Event-Driven Feedback:** A countdown timer updates and triggers a summary display after 60 seconds, showcasing the application's dynamic response to user interactions.

## Code Structure
The code is structured across multiple packages (`package1` and `package2`):
- `package1` contains the main class (`CoffeeMachine`) managing the GUI elements and interactions.
- `package2` holds classes related to drinks, discounts, and a secondary window displaying the order summary.

## Overview
Overall, this application provides a simple functional illustration of a cafe ordering system through a Java-based GUI.
